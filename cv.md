## about me
I've dabbled in front-end development before on platforms like Hexlet, HTML Academy, FreeCodeCamp, and YouTube. I took a UX-UI course on Coursera. I'm learning English and Korean languages on the side. Had some breaks in learning, but my interest didn't fade, so now I want to solidify my grasp of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript basics. My goal is to start coding and dive deeper into the world of development.
